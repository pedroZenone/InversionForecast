# InversionForecast

This proyect yas quite challenging because I had to predict the investment of the competitors of 4 south american countries. The problema here was that I only had 10 years of history and they wanted to predict 2 years ahead! So I decided to use models with high bias and trait data in a very carefully way. I land on an R2 of 0.7... kind of acceptable for this problem.

My input data was conposed by:

- Nielsen data (sales by month)
- IBOPE data (investment opened by channels and ratio on that media)
- Macroeconomic data (inflation, demos, PBI, etc)
- Weather data (without sense.. because it was investment not sales but I forced to added it)
